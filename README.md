## What I learned

In this project we were introduced to API calls using AJAX. I had a lot of fun with this one. I really enjoy getting live data to use in projects that can be useful to a user. Ive learned how to read through API documentation to see how to implement said data and utilize javascript/jquery to place that data into the DOM.
